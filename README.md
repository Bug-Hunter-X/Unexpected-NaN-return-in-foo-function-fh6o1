# Unexpected NaN return in foo functionThis JavaScript code demonstrates an uncommon error where the function `foo` unexpectedly returns `NaN` when it receives `undefined` as the second argument and the first argument is not 1. The issue lies in the loose comparison (`==`) used in the `if` condition. When `a` is `undefined` and `b` is a number, the addition `a + b` results in `NaN` because of type coercion.  This readme explains the problem and how it can be fixed.
